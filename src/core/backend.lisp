;;;; backend.lisp — what Cadre asks of a running Lisp, whichever Lisp it is
;;;;
;;;; A LISP-CONNECTION is a connection to a running Common Lisp (through
;;;; Swank, swank/), and later Clojure (nREPL) or Racket (Cadre's own back
;;;; end). The editor asks for things through the BACKEND-… generic functions
;;;; below, never a protocol's own calls, except for features only one
;;;; protocol has (the Swank debugger's restarts, the inspector, tracing…),
;;;; which it checks with BACKEND-SUPPORTS-P first.
;;;;
;;;; Requests are asynchronous: ON-OK is called with the value (on the thread
;;;; the connection delivers on, the GTK thread in the editor), or ON-ABORT
;;;; with a reason. Values have Swank's shapes, which the UI already parses
;;;; (forms.lisp, tools.lisp), so each back end answers in those shapes:
;;;;   eval, describe, macroexpand   a string
;;;;   arglist                       a string, or nil
;;;;   autodoc                       (string cacheable-p)
;;;;   completions                   (((name score chunks flags) …) …), fuzzy-completions'
;;;;   definitions                   ((label location) …), locations as PARSE-LOCATION reads
;;;;   xref                          as swank:xref (one kind) or swank:xrefs (several)
;;;;   compile-form, compile-file    a compilation result, as PARSE-COMPILATION-RESULT reads
